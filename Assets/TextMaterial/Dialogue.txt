INTRO:
You are a college student and is currently living in the campus dorm with your friend.
You can rest at your bed (right side), use your computer, or change your pants using the wardrobe.
You can use the computer to work side hustles to earn money. You can then use said money to buy stuff online.
For this demo test, you can only do stuff in this room. Other places are on progress.
Increase your desperation meter and unlock wetting events.
To help achieve this, we have broken down your toilet so you can't use it at all!
Enjoy the game!

BoxerCleanup
You go to the bathroom to wash up and change into a clean pair of boxers.
After you're dry, you go out to face the huge puddle you made.
You grab a mop and start cleaning the floor up.
You: It's all clean now.

JeansCleanup
You go to the bathroom to wash up and change into a clean pair of jeans.
After you're dry, you go out to face the huge puddle you made. You roll up the bottom of your jeans to prevent them from accidentally soaking up more pee from the floor.
You grab a mop and start cleaning the floor up.
You: It's all clean now.

DiaperCleanup
You go to the bathroom and take off your diaper. You fold it and throw it in a plastic bag.
You wash up a little as well.
After everything is clean, you go out to dump the plastic bag in the trash container.

Work Event 0
You try to look for side hustles on an online freelancer platform.
It's hard to find a good one and it's starting to stress you out.
You: It's so hard to find a job nowadays...
After looking for a good while, you finally found a good one.
However, the stress from looking for a job somehow makes you more desperate to go.

Work Event 1
You work on the project for a long time.
Once it's ready, you send it to the client for a review.
You've worked a long time without a bathroom break. Your desperation grows..

Work Event 2
You're finally done with work and the client wishes to put you on a Zoom meeting so you can explain your work.

Work Event 3
You decide that you can manage to hold it in throughout the entirety of the meeting.
...
Halfway through the meeting, you start feeling a light trickle in your groin.

Work Event Pee 2
You leaked a bit, but you manage to stop it quick enough.
You: (It's just a small leak.. It's still under control...)
However, a couple of minutes later, you start leaking again.

Work Event Pee 3
You: (Fuck fuck fuck)
You also manage to stop this one before it gets out of hand, but your desperation is apparent.
You: (Well.. it's an online meeting anyway, so nobody will know even if I pee myself...)
Once that realization sets in, you decide to leak small spurts to relieve yourself throughout the meeting.
However, the feeling of warm and wet groin is not helping you with how desperate you are.

Work Event Pee 4
The last leak was longer and harder. You rub around your pants and find that it's wet. Some of it even went on the chair.
It's getting harder to control yourself, but you try to keep a steady voice throughout your presentation regarding the work you've done.
Not long after, you feel yourself unconsciously trickling steadily underneath, warming your groin.
You: (...I think peeing myself is unavoidable at this point. Let's just hope the noise cancellation can hide the noise...)
You slowly relax your muscles, deciding to just let it all out.

Work Event Pee 5
The dam has broken completely. The loud noise is very concerning, but you try your hardest to hold it only to fail.
The noise cancellation seems to also fail you. The client is saying that your voice is unclear due to a loud noise.
You apologize and make up the excuse that a water pipe broke down, then you mute your mic and pretend that you're trying to fix it.
After muting, you start peeing even harder.
You: (Ah.. that feels good..)
After peeing it all out, you unmute yourself again to say that the problem is fixed and you continue on with your presentation.
The client seems to not suspect anything and you earn yourself a paycheck by the end of the meeting.

Work Event Diaper 2
You leak a bit into your diaper.
Feeling protected, you leak even more.

Work Event Diaper 3
The warm sensation makes you feel pretty good.
You start leaking more and more into your diaper, filling it more with urine.
The constant leaking and the feeling of protection makes it harder for you to control your pee.

Work Event Diaper 4
The last leak was bigger and longer than expected, and your diaper starts swelling.
The overall wet and warm sensation under you is very tempting.
Without you realizing it, you have started slowly releasing your bladder.
You only realize it when you feel your groin getting wetter and wetter by the second.
Needing to focus on the presentation you're delivering, you finally decide to just let it all go.

Work Event Diaper 5
You start peeing steadily into your diapers and you can feel it expanding by the second.
What was once a lukewarm diaper is now rapidly increasing in temperature as you keep filling it up with fresh pee.
You are already peeing at maximum speed into your diaper but it's still showing no signs of stopping even after so long. You start worrying if your diaper can handle all the pee.
Your crotch and bum now feels like they're swimming in your own piss, feeling very warm and wet.
Feeling worried that it may leak combined with the pleasure you're getting from peeing yourself, your heart starts beating faster and louder.
The amount of pee that you're letting out is very surprising, as it's still showing no signs of stopping after what seems like an eternity.
You feel relieved after you feel your stream finally slowing down. Your hand rubs around your pants and find them dry. You give a sigh of relief.
You peek through the bands of your diaper and see that there's just a small lake of piss sitting under you, unabsorbed. You can't do anything about it at this point, however, since you're still presenting in a meeting.
After your presentation is over and the client is satisfied, you finally get your paycheck.

First Use Diaper
You: (I can't believe I'm really doing this... A college student having to wear diapers.. Really?)
You go to the bathroom and put on the diaper. You wear jeans over it to hide the fact.
You: (Now I'm making crinkly plastic sounds whenever I walk... Let's just hope nobody notices...)

First Buy Diaper
You: (...Honestly, I don't even know if I would ever need this...)
You: (But I'm just feeling kinda curious as to what wearing diapers feel like...)
You: (Hmm, let's just hope my roommate won't see me buying it.)
